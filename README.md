(I'm easier to read in a web browser, unless you get / like markdown syntax)

<http://github.com/rdallman/gofirst/blob/master/README.md>

Just in case, a `$` just denotes to type in shell, don't actually type the `$`

### go get it (words to live by)

`
$ go get github.com/rdallman/gofirst
`

__if this doesn't work, you'll need to fix your $GOPATH__

Raise your hand, we're here to help

### If you build it, they will come

`
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/rdallman/gofirst
`

`
$ go install
`

### run the created binary

`
$ gofirst
`

### open a browser, type in 'localhost:8080/gopher'

P.S. try some other urls, you'll catch on

### That's all there is to it! _go_ dig around in firstserver.go

`
$ EDITOR firstserver.go
`

where `EDITOR` = `vim`, `subl`, `nano`, `emacs`, etc.

### When you're comfortable with this...

`
$ go get github.com/rdallman/goserver
`

`
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/rdallman/goserver
`

`
$ EDITOR README.md
`

or you can view the README on
<https://github.com/rdallman/goserver/blob/master/README.md>

You can close out of this readme now, but it might be handy to keep `firstserver.go` open in your
editor for the first few steps of the next tutorial.
